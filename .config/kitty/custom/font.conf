#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at
#: a time or only the current one.

#: Font selection (use Monospace for system default, or pick a specific font)
#: Note: Monospace currently resolves to "DejaVu Sans Mono" on this system
font_family      Monospace
#font_family      MonoLisa     # Premium font, 9.5pt - excellent readability
#font_family      Hack         # Popular coding font, designed for source code
#font_family      Fira Code    # Includes programming ligatures
#font_family      JetBrains Mono # Optimized for developer experience
#font_family      Ubuntu Mono  # Clean, open-source monospace
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font
#: families that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick,
#: etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic

#font_size 9.5
font_size 7.5
# 8 gives slightly worse rendering without changing the size when compared with 7.5

#: Font size (in pts)
map kitty_mod+equal     change_font_size current +0.5
map kitty_mod+minus     change_font_size current -0.5
map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size current 0

#: To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current OS window's font
#: size::
#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0
